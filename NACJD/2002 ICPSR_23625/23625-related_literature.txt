This BJS Special Report uses data from victims' reports to the NCVS from
July 2000 through December 2003 and from police reports to the FBI's
Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) in 2002 to describe characteristics
of hate crimes. Information is provided on the motivations for hate crime
as perceived by victims, the types of crimes which victims thought were
hate-related, reasons for reporting or not reporting hate crimes to police,
police response to victim's notification of a crime, the time and place at
which hate crimes occurred and offenders' gender, race, age, relationship
to the victim, use of weapons, and gang membership.

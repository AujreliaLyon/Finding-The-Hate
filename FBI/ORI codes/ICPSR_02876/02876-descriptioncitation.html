		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> Researchers have long been able to analyze crime and law
enforcement data at the individual agency level (see UNIFORM CRIME
REPORTING PROGRAM DATA: [UNITED STATES] [ICPSR 9028]) and at the
county level (see, for example, UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA
[UNITED STATES]: COUNTY-LEVEL DETAILED ARREST AND OFFENSE DATA, 1997
[ICPSR 2764]). However, analyzing crime data at the intermediate
level, the city or place, has been difficult. To facilitate the
creation and analysis of place-level data, the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data
(NACJD) created the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk. The
crosswalk file was designed to provide geographic and other
identification information for each record included in either the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) files or
BJS's Directory of Law Enforcement Agencies. The main variables for
each record are the UCR originating agency identifier number, agency
name, mailing address, Census Bureau's government identification
number, UCR state and county codes, and Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) state, county, and place codes. These variables make
it possible for researchers to take police agency-level data, combine
them with Bureau of the Census and BJS data, and perform place-level,
jurisdiction-level, and government-level analyses.</span></p>
